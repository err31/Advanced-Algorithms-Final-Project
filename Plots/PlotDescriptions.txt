GE10-GE1000 contain the different runtimes based on iterations with the Gaussian elimination data

noGE100-noGE1000 contain the different runtime based on iterations without the Gaussian elimination data

GEruntime contains the different runtimes based on matrix dimensions with fixed 100 iterations with Gaussian elimination data

noGEruntime contains the different runtimes based on matrix dimensions with fixed 100 iterations without Gaussian elimination data
